Management needs to understand the health of their company culture and how employees perceive the organization. So, how can they find out how their staff feels? With the right questions and, just as important, the right employee engagement tool.

This widespread challenge of employee satisfaction is why many agencies are renewing their focus on company culture and conducting employee engagement surveys. Once they find a highly skilled, valuable employee, they want to keep them -- especially today, when top talent has endless options for where to pitch their tent and make a professional home.

Investing in Company Culture

In addition, culture is one differentiating factor an agency can promote to potential candidates. Why work for one agency or another? Money and the type of clients or work can influence a candidate's decision, but many people also consider the type of people they would be working with and the values of the organization. This can be as, if not more, persuasive when it's time to decide.  

But for a company culture to exist, management must be focused on employee happiness and engagement. This isn't an easy task. Deloitte outlined 20 engagement factors companies need to consider and excel at to keep employees engaged. And most organizations are starting from a place of weakness: Gallup found in 2014 that 13% of all employees are "highly engaged" and 26% are "actively disengaged."

Tracking Employee Engagement 

To increase employee engagement, agencies need a better idea of how happy, fulfilled, challenged, and dedicated employees are. They also need a system for soliciting feedback and tracking satisfaction and issues over time. Only with this information can leadership address issues, make changes, and improve their agency's employee engagement. 

To get you started gathering insight from your staff, we've put together a list of some of the best employee feedback and culture tools. Check them out to see which one might help you make improvements in your own firm:

The 1:1 meeting is essential to employee performance and development. It’s a powerful tool that allows managers and employees to develop a trusting relationship, address issues in real time, and align on progress. According to a study by Gallup, employees who have regular 1:1 meetings with their managers are three times more likely to be engaged than those who don’t.
